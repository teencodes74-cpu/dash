# Audio assets

This project intentionally avoids committing binary audio files.

If you want custom sound effects or music, place your own files here:

- `jump.wav` for jump sound
- `music.mp3` for background music

The game still works without these files because `game.js` uses procedural Web Audio fallbacks.
